SENIOR CLIENT SOLUTIONS MANAGER</h2>
<br>
<h2>FEBRUARY 2020 - PRESENT</h2>
<p>Starting initially as a Client Solutions manager focusing on new business development, at 7 months with the company I was promoted to the position of Senior Client Solutions Manager. In my day to day I specialise in providing solutions to current and new clients from a various perspectives. I focus on relationship management with these clients and offer cost effective, client centric solutions either from a Data Consultancy perspective or from a people centred approach. The data centric side involves me working as a project/programme manager, to build, gather information, provide, and liaise with varying teams to create appropriate proposals and manage processes throughout the entire cycle for the clients. Likewise, for a people centred approach, I work with the clients to understand requirements, future roadmaps and provide appropriate solutions and resources to assist them be it from a contract or permanent perspective. These can range from RPO Proposals, graduate scheme ideas, volume recruitment, down to individual surge requirements to on-board and liaise with the internal TA Team quickly and efficiently. My approaches are always outcome and quality focused, to ensure the best outcomes both commercially for the company and for the client with the strongest relationship standpoint to move forward with. 
    More recently, I have also taken on further responsibilities to account manage a number of public and private sector accounts from a growth and continued relationship viewpoint. This has meant understanding public sector frameworks (for which I have volunteered to help business support teams with MI Reporting) as well as ensuring quality and compliance within the private sector as well.

<h2>SALES MANAGER</h2>
<br>
<h2>AUGUST 2019 - DECEMBER 2019</h2>
<br>
<p>Having left the recruitment sector I began as a Business Development Manager, looking after three key clients to begin with which grew to 5 within my time there. These clients were ranging in sector from specialists IT, Events & Entertainment and Raw materials - this helped build my ability to adapt to varying situations and sectors in order to research appropriately and learn quickly to drive sales. I was tasked with developing business for those companies through strategic use of LinkedIn, cur-rent connections as well as phone calls and emails to build trust worthy relationships very quickly. Subsequent to this, I was promoted to Sales Manager of the team of Business Development Managers (of which there were 5) and this involved still maintaining my current clients whilst motivating, developing and training the team for sales and the use of the internal systems.. For these I was involved in structuring and assisting with tenders for multi-million pound deals as well as working with smaller elements to ensure immediate results.
