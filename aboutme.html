      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alistair, I've always had a passion for technology and over the last few years it's developed into the need to know more! With that being said, I'm absolutely at the start of the journey, but already feel the addiction coming to life!
          I'm currently in a sales based role, but in the offtime I do have, this is going to be a focus of mine. So far I've used Codecademy to get me to where I am and I'm going to continue to learn and experiment with as many things
          as possible! 
      </p>
